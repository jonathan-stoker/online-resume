<h3>Guitar</h3>
<p>I've been playing since I was young!  I play various fingerstyle and classical songs.  
    These days I use a Gretsch G5655TG.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I am hobbyist designer!  I mostly make custom birthday cards for my friends.  I use GIMP.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Of course I like video games.  I love RPGs (and online RPGs), as well as old school shoot em up games.</p>
